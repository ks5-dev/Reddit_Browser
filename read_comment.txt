And I made a web version of my Python regex book: https://learnbyexample.github.io/py_regular_expressions/ASIC_SP1
Great video! Do you have any tips on the best way to store and call your login credentials so they arenâ€™t saved in with the code?Snide18250
I love Selenium, have automated a thing or two at work with it. Any advice on how to avoid triggering CAPTCHAs?kpgleeso14
Had to use Selenium recently for a project at work, changing some device control settings through Ethernet ports. Fantastic little add on library and seems like itâ€™s endlessly usable, love how complex you can get with browser manipulation through it! Fantastic video, cheers my dude!Haz24078
Nice video but I prefer explicit waits from the WebDriverWait class than calling implicit waits throughout the scripts. Itâ€™s one of the debate points from general Selenium usage to be fair.psyn1c6
Just did the same thing using Puppeteer. Any advantages of Selenium over Puppeteer?spektrol3
I was literally JUST trying to figure this out yesterday and I couldnâ€™t figure it out. Thanks for the post.Bodark2
Glad I had a look at this, the webdriver-manager is going to be really useful in the future.aka_Foamy1
Iâ€™m learning selenium with tech with Timâ€™s video, but I will make sure to check yours out! Iâ€™m trying to log in to reddit and then post something with my automated program! I can log in, go to the community, but right when I want to tap create post, I get this chrome pop up that tells me reddit wants to send notifications. I have no idea what to do, I blocked it in my site settings and turned off all kinds of notifications in my account settings, but itâ€™s popping up after a cpl of actions i do. Is there a way to press the pop up from chrome, and block or allow notifications? Itâ€™s not html, I canâ€™t inspect it and click. If anyone knows how, help would be much appreciated!!!!fecesmuncher691
Good one. Would be great to have video about strategies not to be Identified by services that youâ€™ve been scraping them.No-Ingenuity-94251
Nice video! Clear and easy to understand!!iamvm1
This video is smooth as butter. Quick, digestible bite with a strong content core. Thanks budr3ign_b3au1
I learned about Selenium years ago and its so cool that its still being used! Its a great integration tester for any type of website. I have set it up on CircleCI and Travis and it just runs its tests. 

The only issue some people will have is its comparative slowness compared to other integration test tools. But ill take a little speed decrease for sanity any day.mesamunefire1
I like the fact that people use Selenium for more than just UI testing using PageObject model. After all itâ€™s built on accessibility OS features that are really powerful, and asserting logo.jpg is present is a total waste IMO.psyn1c1
I love selenium... Used it to scrape thousands of images from google. 

Nice video.im_a_brat1
Thanks for posting this. I'e been using Selenium for a while now, still haven't figured out a way to have it rename download files, e.g. download a file from [salesforce.com](https://salesforce.com) titled by default report12321.csv to instead have it named performance.csv. Any idea if this possible? if so, how?Yosarian221
Nice one! I use it a lot.pantuts1
I want to login to a website which asks your email first to send 2fa. User would then input that 2fa code to see the login screen. 
How can I do that? I have previously automated simple login screens. But for this scenario I'm clueless.theusamah1
Dude you are awesome! Thank you, thank you, and thank you!!!abdelreddit981
Cool tutorial! I will likely try this on my own. What would be different if your default browser was Edge?hampstermic1

We have found, both in college and in the workplace, that sometimes people find git intimidating to use because of all the commands you need to remember.

Gitutor is a command line application that wraps git and provides beginner friendly versions of git's commands. It makes git easy.

Some of Gitutor's features:

* Create local repositories and link them to github in one command
* You can easily undo changes
* Interactive menus that make your life easier
* Have a cheatsheet right on your terminal

You can check out the tutorial and installation guide on our website: [https://gitutor.io/guide/](https://gitutor.io/guide/)

Right now the project is in beta , if you find any bugs or would like additional features please email us at [support@gitutor.io](mailto:support@gitutor.io)andrscyv2
We need more projects like this! good jobprams6281
Source code:  [https://github.com/rafael-fuente/Python-Raytracer](https://github.com/rafael-fuente/Python-Raytracer)

This was a fun project made in my spare time. (it took me two months to finish it)

Some of the features implemented are refraction, thin film interference, textures, camera lens ,path tracing and animations.

The animation was done rendering frame by frame. Each frame take a few seconds to render in a fast computer.

Every question, critic, improvement about the source code is welcome and grateful!

Can you describe how did you get there? did you follow some tutorials or other examples? what documentation did you use?parfamz22
Wow dude, Iâ€™m still new to programming, but I never thought python could do things like this!WhatsTheIP20
THIS GOT ONLY 137 UPVOTES IN /R/MADEINPYTHON!?


God this is glorious. Well done! Im not sure if this is new, but its new to me with python.you-cant-twerk69

Wonderful work!  How fast does it render?CantankerousMind6
Good lord that is beautiful and this deserves a lot more attention!!!frankstan334
Finally some noticeable work on r/Python. Well done mate, Iâ€™ve made a few raytracers myself and this is outstanding.k0wabunga5
I have no idea what is happening here. I will pretend to understand something. Maybe you  could do some contribution to blender community.Curious_homosepian4
What is the Blinn Phong model for thin film interference? Is it a Perlin noise thing?Hamoodzstyle3
Can't believe this only uses pillow and numpy, amazing stuff! I'll be taking a look at the code, thanks for publishing it.IcecreamLamp3

THAT'S SO GOOD MAN!annuallyjason2
That's really awesome ! I'm working a lot with thin film deposition in semiconductor R&D, and I'm pretty sure it could really be useful.Kortak1302

This is something else. CongratulationsHandsOfSugar2
Looks cool! Have you tried rendering some more substantial geometry? I wonder how fast it is, definitely a cool project!asbox2
This is so beautiful, wow! Nice work.pgh_ski2

Jesus, I'm proud that I made battleship with square brackets and asterisks.

How long did that take to render? Does it leverage a GPU at all?Paradigm67901
I'm sorry sir, you are overqualified for the positionturingparade1
That is verly cool. I have tried this in python once but I was not satisfied with the performance. What have you done to improve it so much? I am currently trying to use OpenGL functions to render it using the GPU but doing custom calculations with OpenGL is quite challenging and im already thinking about a re-write in Go.hyred-1
That's fucking righteous dudetechnocal1
